    "Linear programming is a method to achieve the best outcome (maximum profit/minimum profit) in a mathematical model. The objective function is to optimize a linear objective function, subject to non-negative, linear equality and inequality constraints.\n",

    "1. Decision variables: variables that decision-makers control to optimize the objective function\n",
    "2. Objective function: The mathematical expression representing the quantity to be maximized or minimized\n",
    "3. Constraints: The restrictions/limitations on the decision variables. Constraints can be represented as linear inequalities or equalities\n",
    "4. Feasible region: the set of all possible solutions that satisfy the constraints\n",
    "5. Optimal solution: the solution that maximizes or minimizes the objective function within the feasible region\n",

    "- linear inequalities are represented by half-space which satisfies all the points in a boundary or line\n",

    "- Let n bet the total number of decision variables (non-basic variables)\n",
    "- Let m be the number of constraints (non-basic variables)\n",
    "- We can find the total number of vertices in a polytope by choosing n elements from a set of n+m elements (total variables) $\\begin{pmatrix} n+m \\\\ n \\end{pmatrix}$\n",

    "### Finding optimal solution\n",
    "In general, it is possible to find all vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the objective function $\\mathrm{C}^T\\mathbf{x}$ at each vertex to find the optimal solution. However, if there are many vertices, it will be time-consuming to compute the optimal solution at every vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function defines a hyperplane that passes through orthogonally to the vertex of the polytope, and therefore can contain non-optimal solution. The optimal solution corresponds to the point where the objective function hyperplane is orthogonal to the half-spaces created by the inequalities.\n"
