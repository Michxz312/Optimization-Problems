    "An optimal solution of a linear programming problem occurs at a vertex of the convex polytope of feasible solutions. The simplex method is a very efficient algorithm for traversing the vertices towards an optimal solution. A brute force method would be to just find all vertices and compute values of the objective function at the vertices to find the optimal value. Write a Python program to find all vertices of the convex polytope of feasible solutions of a linear programming problem in standard form. Use this program to write a function which computes a solution of a LP problem. Do some computational experiments to see how the computing time of this brute force algorithm increases with the size of the problem.\n",

    "Pivot Operation\n",
    "The pivot operation in a tableau/dictionary is the essential step in the simplex method. How do we choose entering and leaving variables? When does the algorithm stop? How/why does the optimal value of the objective function appear in the tableau/dictionary? Explain how the pivot operation works and how to interpret the tableau/dictionary matrix."
