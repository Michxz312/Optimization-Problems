    "An efficient way of finding the optimal solution is to use the simplex method, which is an algorithm that adjusts the values of non-basic variables to move from one vertex to an adjacent vertex. It uses pivot operation (recall matrix operations) and exchange a non-basic variable to increase the objective function with a basic variable, changing the current vertex of the polytope.\n",
    "* The method is different than the brute force method of finding all vertices because it focuses on optimizing the objective function\n",
