### Learning Portfolio

1) What is the most important thing that you learned in this course?
I learn to use python solvers (google OR-Tools, CVXPY, linprog) to compute solutions of different optimization problems. 

2) What was your process for creating artifacts?
I generally try to follow the mathematical modelling process, where I define the problem, state the parameters and decision variables, then find the constraints and formulate the problem. Finally, I build a solution and interpret the solution of the solver. 

3) Which artifact are you most proud of?
The first artifact that I created because I completed it and understand what linear programming is better.

4) What did you find most challenging about creating your portfolio? What was most enjoyable?
I find it difficult to visualize some optimization problems and sometimes I get stuck on a problem and my brain doesn't want to move on. It's enjoyable when I finally get the answer that I'm expecting.

5) What guidance would you give to students who are getting started with their own portfolio?
I suggest managing the time properly and give enough time to review each artifact and be more attentive to the details of the optimization problem. If you get stuck, try to review the formulation instead of focusing on the code.
