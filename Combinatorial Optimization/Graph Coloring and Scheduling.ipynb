    "- We can easily decide if a graph can be assigned to 2 colors by checking if the graph can be divided into two sets (bipartite graph). \n",
    "- This is computable in linear time\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the running time is $\\mathcal{O} (2^n)$ if a graph have n vertices with k colors. In the set partitioning problem, we are finding the total ways that the elements can be divided into subsets. For each element, we decide whether to include it or not, so the worst case is 2^n possible combinations. From the different ways of dividing the sets, there might be a set with a number of subset equal to k. \n",

    "It seems that the graph coloring problem is more suitable for the assigning problem because we are assigning k colors to n number of vertices. However, we can turn this into a scheduling problem if we consider the graph in a certain order, treat the vertices like flight legs and the routes as colors. The edges will be treated as a constraint to check if two pairs of vertices have the same color. \n",
